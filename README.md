# rkanoid-like-Game
1 Objectives

This assignment requires you to implement a simple 3D game using the jMonkeyEngine 3.0 library.


2 Game Description

The objective of this assignment is to implement a game inspired by the classic arcade
game Arkanoid, see, for example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid and https:
//youtu.be/--pBWsS867s. The game is played on a rectangular field with solid top and
sides and an open bottom. In the middle of the field, game objects are positioned. A player
controls a moving paddle at the bottom of the field, which prevents the game ball from
falling from the field. The game ball bounces off the paddle, the boundaries and the game
objects on the field. When the game ball strikes a game object on the field, the object is
removed. When all objects are gone, the player wins the round.
In the classic game, the game objects are rectangular. In this assignment, we will use
balls as obstacles.
